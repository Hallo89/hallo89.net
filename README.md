# Hallo89.net

My personal website, a hobby side project, providing a large playground for my projects. It's built on node with Express.

It features some projects I did to learn web development, for example [a page to create cool colored triangles](https://hallo89.net/webgl/triangles) (as a WebGL experiment) and other less useful tools.<br>
It's also hosting [Win95-web](https://github.com/Hallo89/win95-web) and [two Snake games](https://github.com/Hallo89/snake)!

Note that this project uses [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) as package manager as opposed to npm; In order to set this repo up locally, Yarn 2+ has to be installed first.

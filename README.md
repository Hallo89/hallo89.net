# Hallo89.net

A continuation of [hallo89.github.io](https://github.com/Hallo89/hallo89.github.io), going into the next round; Now using Node.js and Express and lots of other exciting stuff!

A website having started as a little side-project of mine, without much of a goal to begin with.
Meanwhile it is actually quite feature-rich and provides a large playground for my projects.

It mostly features projects I did to learn web development, for example a page to create cool colored triangles (as a WebGL experiment) and other less useful tools.<br>
It's also hosting [Win95-web](https://github.com/Hallo89/win95-web)! (Don't ask me why I created this)

Note that this project uses [Yarn 2](https://yarnpkg.com/) as package manager as opposed to npm, without backwards compatibility with the latter. If the unlikely scenario of needing to locally run this project arises, Yarn 2 has to be installed first.

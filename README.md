# Hallo89.net

## - Formerly hallo89.github.io, formerly Some-shitty-website -

A continuation of [hallo89.github.io](https://github.com/Hallo89/hallo89.github.io), going into the next round; Now using Node.js and Express and lots of other exciting stuff!

A website having started as a little side-project of mine, without much confidence, as one can see at the (former) name of it.
Meanwhile it is actually quite feature-rich and a large playground for my projects.

It mostly features projects I did to learn development, for example a page to create cool colored triangles (as a WebGL experiment), an ongoing model creator for Minecraft, a random number generator and other tools.<br>
However, it's also the head of [Slider89](https://github.com/Hallo89/slider89) and a personal blog is in development as well.

Note that this project uses [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) as package manager as opposed to npm, without backwards compatibility with the latter. If the unlikely scenario of needing to locally run this project arises, Yarn has to be installed first.
